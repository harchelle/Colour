# Colour-Contrast
This javascript project was made for the 2019 Science Exhibition by Harchelle.
The neural network was made to recognize if the colour of the web page was dark or light.
You can click on [this link](https://hr-strange37.github.io/Colour-Contrast/index.html) to

### How to Use
There are sliders to give RGB (red-green-blue) value to the colour of the web page.
The neural network checks if this colour is dark or light.
